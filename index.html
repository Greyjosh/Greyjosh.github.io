            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Josh, and I am an aspiring developer and data analyst who has recently graduated. I have explored various fields within data analysis and application development, gaining experience with programming languages and web technologies. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation 
              in solving complex problems and driving innovation. I am passionate about continuous learning, eager to leverage and apply my skills to create impactful and meaningful solutions.

            <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p>
               Playing the guitar is a significant part of my life, especially enjoying songs by Red Hot Chili Peppers and
              Jimi Hendrix. I also spend a good amount of time creating my own music, which allows me to express myself creatively. 
              As a passionate gamer, I immerse myself in a wide range of games like World of Warcraft, Cities: Skylines, and Diablo 4.
              I allow myself to reset by exploring nature through walks and trails, often sharing these experiences with friends to fully appreciate the beauty of the world.
              These interests help me maintain a balanced and fulfilling life.
            </p>
